# nyx has been shut down, now i am working on its second installation, flux. Flux will be much better including steps on how to set up your own server. you can find flux here: https://github.com/chompypotato/flux/

# Nyx 

### Nyx does not require a server (well it does but it is hosted elsewhere) so it can be hosted on static providers. (but not github pages)
### Nyx has lots of cool things
### - Looks cool
### - Themes
### - Games
### - AI
### - Apps
### - Cloaking
### - And more to come!
